# Ansible Inventories, Playbooks & Variables

## Overview

Using the inventory, vars & playbooks either already contained in this folder or generated by Terraform, we are able to execute commands on all the Solace Broker, Cache & Client nodes.

## Highlights

There are 2 subdirectories in this repository:

### [inventory](./inventory) 

This path will be used to store the Ansible Inventory files created by Terraform.

### [playbooks](./playbooks) 

This path already contains Ansible playbooks & variable files, but some other required files will get created by Terraform.

There is currently a single folders inside playbooks: 
- [bootstrap](./playbooks/bootstrap) - This folder contains the playbooks, variables & roles required for configuring the Solace Brokers, Cache & Client nodes.
